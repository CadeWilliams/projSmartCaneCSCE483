## Project management status
1. Currently we are waiting on getting our Purchase Order approved so we can order the components and start testing them. On the meantime, we are ensuring that we all are in the same page in terms of how this product will work and how the components will come together. Also, we will be polishing the overall design and start working on the software design.
2. Now that we have a schedule of milestones we need to meet, we have a rough estimate on how long each portion will take and are able to split the work more efficiently.
