| 2 | Smart Cane | 2/3/2020 | Baltazar Guerra L. |


## Agenda for the meeting
1. Re-state the problems that are faced by visually impaired people and, following Justin's advice, decide on whether we should focus on a robust system with multiple settings that can be toggled, or try to fully perfect a device with just one of those settings while still fulfilling the requirements.
2. Try to contact the people that made the mobile app for the Zachry Engineering Building to get some inspiration from their system for detecting where in the building a given user is. This would help us tremendously in trying to incorporate navigation features to the cane.
3. Make plans for our following meeting and spread assignments amongst ourselves.

## Overall accomplishments since last meeting
1. We had a meeting with Justin from Texas A&M Disability Services. We talked about our initial ideas and heard his thoughts. He then gave us a summary of the most common difficulties that he and his peers (who are also blind) face and explained to us how he is able to use technology to his aid. At the end of the meeting, it was concluded that we either had to make a very robust system so users could toggle the types of feedback and aid they would receive (auditory or sensory), or just focus on one specific aspect of the cane and specialize on it.
2. We gathered all of our initial ideas from our brainstorming session and the insight data that we gathered from Justin to complete the problem statement.

## Project management status
1. Now that we have a better understanding of what problems our target audience faces, we have been able to focus on our initial ideas that do tackle these problems. We will come to a concensus on whether we should make a robust system, or just focus on perfecting a specific aspect of the cane.
