| 2 | Smart Cane | 2/3/2020 | Baltazar Guerra L. |


## Agenda for the meeting
1. Talk about our discoveries from the topics discussed in last class. The whole purpose was to know which ideas we should keep for the product, to compare with previously made products while trying to improve them, and start making a list of the cost for the components.
2. Discard some of the ideas that do not match with our goal/plan. In other words, thinning out all the possibilities we had thought of.
3. Make plans for our following meeting and spread assignments amongst ourselves.

## Overall accomplishments since last meeting
1. We had a meeting with Justin from Texas A&M Disability Services. We talked about our initial ideas and heard his thoughts. He then gave us a summary of the most common difficulties that he and his peers (who are also blind) face and explained to us how he is able to use technology to his aid. At the end of the meeting, it was concluded that we either had to make a very robust system so users could toggle the types of feedback and aid they would receive (auditory or sensory), or just focus on one specific aspect of the cane and specialize on it.
2. We gathered all of our initial ideas from our brainstorming session and the insight data that we gathered from Justin to complete the problem statement.

## Project management status
1. Now that we have a better understanding of what problems our target audience faces, we have been able to focus on our initial ideas that do tackle these problems. We will come to a concensus on whether we should make a robust system, or just focus on perfecting a specific aspect of the cane.
