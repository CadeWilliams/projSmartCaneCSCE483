## Agenda for the meeting
1. Talk about our discoveries from the topics discussed in last class. The whole purpose was to know which ideas we should keep for the product, to compare with previously made products while trying to improve them, and start making a list of the cost for the components.
2. Discard some of the ideas that do not match with our goal/plan. In other words, thinning out all the possibilities we had thought of.
3. Make plans for our following meeting. Start working on the problem statement.

## Overall accomplishments since last meeting
1. Got a hold of Disability Services. Will have a meeting to discuss in detail what features could help the everyday life of visually impaired people.
2. We have the cost-range for the sensors we're planning on using. We also have the range at which said sensors are most optimal.
