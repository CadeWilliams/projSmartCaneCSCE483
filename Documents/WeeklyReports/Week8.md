## Agenda for the meeting
1. Update on the functionality of the components we had received.
2. Do a follow-up meeting once we have another meeting with Justing C. where we will see how he uses mobile apps and his smartphone in general.
3. Check when we will receive the remaining components.

## Overall accomplishments since last meeting
1. Split the workload with the entire team. Some are working on the hardware design and implementation, while others are working on the software side. Both groups are doing tests as we progress in our sections.
2. Setup the Raspberry Pi so we can test the components and, later on, the bluetooth communication with the smartphone.
3. Scheduled a follow-up meeting with Justin C. to further discuss how he uses phone apps and if our initial design for the interface sounds like something ideal.

## Project management status
1. We are waiting on the remaining components to arrive in order to do more measurement testing. 
2. Since we now have some components that we can start testing, we have "split" up into 2 groups to tackle both the hardware and software side of the project.
3. At the moment the hardware group is working on testing the components we have to make sure the readings can be used, while the software side is focusing on the UI of the mobile application and testing the communication between the Raspberri Pi.
