# Weekly Report and Meeting Agenda


| Report # | Project Name | Date | Prepared By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | Smart Cane | 4/8/2020 | Baltazar Guerra L. |


## Agenda for the meeting
1. Schedule the times when we will meet up to exchange the components.
2. Get to more specifics on how the breadcrumb will work and the indoor navigation in general (if viable).
3. Double check that we have everything to build the prototype for the outdoor navigation.

## Overall accomplishments since last meeting
1. Finished the app for outdoor navigation.
2. Tested the sensors with the vibrating motors so they would give haptic feedback if there is an obstacle too close.
3. 2nd Pi is on the way so we can make more progress at the same time.

## Tasks completed by each team member since last meeting

| Task description | Assigned to | Completed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finalize testing the components assigned. Incorporate the components in unison. |  Baltazar Guerra L.  | Yes |
| Construct device housing. | Matthew Giuffrida | Yes |
| Finalize outdoor navigation interface. | Shawn Popal | Yes |
| Start using YOLO V3 with the cameras. | Jonathan Williams | Yes |
| Order another Pi to test the components for indoor navigation. | Arthur Helmen | Yes |


## Plans for next period
1. Start using YOLO V3 (image detection software) for obstacle detection with the cameras.
2. Get together with all the components and start making the physical prototype.
3. Work on the PI code that will use the vibrating motors and sensors (currently we have the code on Arduino).
4. Depending on the progress with the physical prototype, start working on the indoor navigation.

## Project management status
1. As of now, 4 of us are in College Station and Shawn Popal is in Dallas. Since he is mostly working on the software side of the project, that aspect doesn't hold us back. 
2. We are going to have some problems when it comes to testing the communication between the Pi and the App since Shawn is away and can make the collaboration a bit difficult (since for this we have to interact with hardware and debug accordingly).
3. Now it is official that we will use Google Maps rather than Aggie Maps.
4. Again, the speed of progress for our project has been brought down due to the current situation. Debugging, testing, and adapting will take a lot longer since we can't all be together as a group.
5. We have a 2nd Pi on the way so we can work with the Pi code and testing with 2 people.
6. Having indoor navigation is still something that could be excluded in the end. Depends on how fast we are able to get the prototype and the outdoor navigation working.
