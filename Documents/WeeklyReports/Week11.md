## Agenda for the meeting
1. Work on finishing the CDR Report.
2. Report on our progress with testing the components and building the iOS App.
3. See who is the best fit to start getting the hardware components together.
4. Check if we will 100% need to solder some components on the board so we can order a soldering kit from the department.
5. Talk about our follow-up steps to start building a prototype.
6. Decide what to do with the GPS module. I (Baltazar) tried testing it on my Arduino UNO, but it was impossible to do so because I required 2 serial ports and the UNO only has 1.

## Overall accomplishments since last meeting
1. Split the components for testing. Baltazar had the Gyro + Accelerometer, the ultrasonic sensors, and the vibrating motors. Jonathan had the Raspberry Pi, the cameras, and the battery.
2. Performed tests on the Ultrasonic sensors to see if they worked well for our scenarios. What we found is that they are more efficient at a distance of under 5ft. When it's at a greater distance, there is a little variance on the readings, but nothing too significant. 
3. Made tests with the different cameras that we received to see which one worked best. We saw that the camera with the longer lens was the most optimal one since it was better at focusing and had better resolution.
4. We have most of the layout for the iOS App done. Right now the user can slide through the screen to select the building they wish to go to, and the App uses Google Maps to get their location and be able to guide them. The App also says out loud the selection so the user can know what building they are choosing.
5. Given the current situation from the pandemic, we're still talking of alternative courses of action since groupwork for building and testing the prototype are being heavily affected. One of them is having the App doing most (if not all) of the work.

## Project management status
1. As of now, 4 of us are in College Station and Shawn Popal is in Dallas. Since he is mostly working on the software side of the project, that aspect doesn't hold us back. 
2. We are going to have some problems when it comes to testing the communication between the Pi and the App since Shawn is away and can make the collaboration a bit difficult (since for this we have to interact with hardware and debug accordingly).
3. We have most of the components tested. I (Baltazar) also had the GPS module to test on my Arduino UNO, but later found out that it wouldn't be possible (as already explained in the report). With that being said, I will have to pass on the component to Jonathan or Arthur so they can test it with the Pi.
4. Now it is official that we will use Google Maps rather than Aggie Maps.
5. Again, the speed of progress for our project has been brought down due to the current situation. Debugging, testing, and adapting will take a lot longer since we can't all be together as a group.
6. Although we are still going forward on making a physical prototype and using the Pi plus other hardware, we still keep in the back of our minds the possibility of cutting down on some hardware components if it slows us down too much, or maybe go virtual (as the last resort).
