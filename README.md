# Smart Cane
Due to Covid-19, our project was sadly unable to be fully realized with a physical prototype. Instead, our members had to work together and adapt to a rapidly changing environment to create functional software prototypes that could be easily "combined", to simulate the various features of our Smart Cane. 

Our cane's features include a mobile iOS based app for the users to sync with the cane over Bluetooth, a set of IR sensors to detect physical objects and their distances to the cane, and an object recognition system using TensorFlow Lite and a lightweight model courtesy of Google in order to achieve somewhat realtime object recognition on a Raspberry Pi 3. We managed to achieve around 2 FPS using the realtime object recognition.

More detailed descriptions of implementation can be found under Documents/Submissions/Final/SmartCane_Final_Report.pdf
